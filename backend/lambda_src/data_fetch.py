# WIP
# Currently, this code just fetches PDFs from CyBOK (Cyber Security Body of Knowledge) and stores them in a local directory.
# The next steps include fetching a wider variety of content, and storing the fetched documents in an S3 bucket.
# Automated or scheduled fetching of content is also a possibility that is being explored.
