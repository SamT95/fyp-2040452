# UP2040452 Final Year Project

This repository stores the code utilised in my final year project. This is a monorepo containing both backend and frontend code.

## Frontend
The `frontend/` folder contains the source code of the frontend utilised in the project. The frontend was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/).

All styling is done using CSS3 and is fully custom. 

The frontend is a WIP. It aims to provide an interface between a user visiting the site and the retrieval augmented generation chain running on the backend.

## Backend
The `backend/` folder contains the source code of the backend utilised in the project. The backend was created using [Python](https://www.python.org/)
